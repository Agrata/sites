						<ol><h3>Welcome</h3>
			<li>Hi, we’re Agrata Sites and welcome! We’re happy to have you here and we hope you enjoy your stay. When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘Agrata Sites’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run Agrata Sites. This is our agreement that we make with you when you use Agrata Sites and it applies whether you are just browsing our service or using Agrata Sites to build, manage or host your website.</li>
			<li>Thanks for taking the time to read and understand these terms because they govern your use of Agrata Sites and set out your rights and obligations.</li>
			<li>If you can’t, or don’t want to, accept these terms, then we’re sorry but you must not use or browse Agrata Sites.</li>
			<li>You need to be 15 years or over to use Agrata Sites. If you’re under 15 you will need to be under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age, and this adult will be responsible for all your activities.</li>
			<br>
			<h3>Our services</h3>
			<li>What we provide: We provide a platform and website hosting service for you to build and manage a website, access a library of compatible themes provided by creators around the world, and access customer support.</li>
			<li>License: We give you the right to use the Agrata Sites platform, tools, themes and hosting service in the following ways (in legal speak we give you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to):</li>
				<ul>
				<li>use the Agrata Sites platform, host and maintain a website in accordance with these terms;</li>
				<li>use the generated desired subdomain for pre-launch testing;</li>
				<li>map a domain of your own to the website you build with Agrata Sites; and</li>
				<li>use the website built and hosted with Agrata Sites for personal or commercial purposes.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Non-exclusive” means that other users of Agrata Sites will have access to the same templates and themes as you, and they might use it in a way that makes their website look similar to yours.</pre>
			<li>Limitations on License: The license we give you applies only to the extent necessary to allow you to access and use Agrata Sites in accordance with these terms. You cannot copy, re-sell or redistribute (even for free) the Agrata Sites platform, templates or themes. You cannot copy the website you have created on Agrata Sites and use it elsewhere.</li>
			<li>Subscription fees: In order to build, host and maintain a website with Agrata Sites you must pay a monthly or annually subscription fee. The gross monthly or annually subscription fee will be the fee you agree to pay when you start or modify subscription. Your subscription will be limited to a single website. You may build and run multiple websites but each will be subject to its own subscription and associated monthly or annually subscription fees.</li>
			<li>Refunds: We do not generally offer a refund or credit on a purchased subscription unless we have made changes to these terms. If you would like to request a refund you should email us at agrata.inc@gmail.com. We will assess refund requests on their merits. There is generally no obligation to provide a refund or credit in situations like the following:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>you have changed your mind about your subscription;</li>
				<li>you subscribed by mistake;</li>
				<li>you do not have sufficient expertise to use the features made available;</li>
				<li>you ask for goodwill; or</li>
				<li>you can no longer access any of your desired features because they have been removed from Agrata Sites.</li>
				</ul>
				If we decide to issue a refund or credit, this will generally be done using the same manner used to make the purchase. Any payment made to you will be made in INR, under the rules of the payment method.
			<li>Cancellation: You may cancel your website subscription at any time. When a subscription is canceled, we will stop charging fees related to that website and remove the website from our hosting so that it is no longer publicly accessible.</li>
			<li>Fine print: We are not a bank or licensed deposit taker in India or elsewhere. Any credit we apply to your subscription is not a deposit under Indian law about banks, and that means you don’t get the benefit of any deposit insurance or guarantee under those laws. We don’t act as a fiduciary or as a trustee for you, and we’re not a licensed financial service provider.</li>
			<br>
			<h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
			<li>You promise that you own (or have a license to use) the IP in any content (such as words, videos, music or pictures) that you create, upload or make public to a website on Agrata Sites.

			<li>Content removal: We can look at or remove any of your content for any reason at our discretion. This might be because we need to provide you with support or correct an issue with your website, or because we receive a copyright take-down notice, or we think that the content or its use is unauthorised, unlawful, misleading, incorrect, offensive, or in breach of anyone else’s rights.</li>
