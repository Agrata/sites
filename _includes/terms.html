				<li>use the website built and hosted with Agrata Sites for personal or commercial purposes.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Non-exclusive” means that other users of Agrata Sites will have access to the same templates and themes as you, and they might use it in a way that makes their website look similar to yours.</pre>
			<li>Limitations on License: The license we give you applies only to the extent necessary to allow you to access and use Agrata Sites in accordance with these terms. You cannot copy, re-sell or redistribute (even for free) the Agrata Sites platform, templates or themes. You cannot copy the website you have created on Agrata Sites and use it elsewhere.</li>
			<li>Subscription fees: In order to build, host and maintain a website with Agrata Sites you must pay a monthly or annually subscription fee. The gross monthly or annually subscription fee will be the fee you agree to pay when you start or modify subscription. Your subscription will be limited to a single website. You may build and run multiple websites but each will be subject to its own subscription and associated monthly or annually subscription fees.</li>
			<li>Refunds: We do not generally offer a refund or credit on a purchased subscription unless we have made changes to these terms. If you would like to request a refund you should email us at agrata.inc@gmail.com. We will assess refund requests on their merits. There is generally no obligation to provide a refund or credit in situations like the following:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>you have changed your mind about your subscription;</li>

			<li>Cancellation: You may cancel your website subscription at any time. When a subscription is canceled, we will stop charging fees related to that website and remove the website from our hosting so that it is no longer publicly accessible.</li>
			<li>Fine print: We are not a bank or licensed deposit taker in India or elsewhere. Any credit we apply to your subscription is not a deposit under Indian law about banks, and that means you don’t get the benefit of any deposit insurance or guarantee under those laws. We don’t act as a fiduciary or as a trustee for you, and we’re not a licensed financial service provider.</li>
